# Hi — I’m Code Rio 👋

I’m a front-end developer focused on building accessible, performant, and user-centered web applications. I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant UI experiences using modern web technologies.

- 🔭 Currently building: production-ready React/TypeScript web apps and component libraries  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced React patterns, performance optimization, and accessibility at scale  
- 📫 Reach me: kayodeanointed@gmail.com | https://www.linkedin.com/in/anointedkayode  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I pair design thinking with code — I write documented components that designers and engineers can reuse.

## Skills

- Core: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React  
- Styling: CSS Modules, Tailwind, styled-components, BEM  
- Tooling: Git, GitHub, Vite, Webpack, ESBuild, npm/yarn  
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (E2E)  
- Performance & QA: Lighthouse, Web Vitals, accessibility (a11y) testing  
- Deployment: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, basic CI with GitHub Actions

---

## How I present projects (what to expect)
For each featured repo I aim to include:
- Live demo or deployment link
- Short README with a one-line summary, tech stack, and setup instructions
- Architecture explanation or component breakdown
- Tests and CI status
- Measurable outcomes (Lighthouse score, responsive performance, or user metric)

This makes it easy for recruiters and collaborators to evaluate front-end craftsmanship quickly.

---

## What I’m learning next
- Advanced React: Suspense, concurrent rendering, server components  
- Component libraries & design systems (Storybook, accessible patterns)  
- Performance engineering: code-splitting, bundle analysis, critical rendering path  
- Accessibility: WCAG best practices and automated/audit workflows  
- Front-end infra: edge deployments (Vercel), SSR, and static site optimizations

## How to collaborate
- Browse my pinned repositories for active work.  
- Open an issue or PR — I welcome feedback and help.  
- Want to chat about a role or collaboration? Email: kayodeanointed@gmail.com

---

## Quick checklist to improve repo signal
- Pin 3–5 top repos (projects you want recruiters to see first).  
- Add a short demo and screenshot/GIF to each project README.  
- Add tests and GitHub Actions CI; show passing badges.  
- Include performance metrics (Lighthouse score, bundle size) and a short note on what you optimized.  
- Add a small CONTRIBUTING.md if you want external contributions.
