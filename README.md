# Hi — I’m Code Rio 👋

I’m a front-end developer who builds accessible, performant, and user-centered web experiences using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React). This profile highlights my favorite projects and shows how to run them locally, what I learned building them, and next steps I’m taking to level up.

- 🔭 Currently building: component-driven React apps and polished portfolio experiences  
- 🌱 Learning: advanced React patterns, performance optimization, and accessibility (a11y)

## Featured projects

Below are three projects I maintain. Each entry includes the tech used, how to run it locally, and the core things I focused on while building it.

### 1) tobi-portfolio
Repo: https://github.com/Coderio10/tobi-portfolio  
Short: Personal portfolio website showcasing projects, contact info, and case studies.

Tech
- React, TypeScript (or JavaScript), CSS / Tailwind (or plain CSS), Vite / Create React App (adjust per repo)

What I focused on
- Clear, responsive layout that highlights projects and case studies
- Fast load time and good Lighthouse score (images optimized, code-splitting)
- Reusable components for project cards, contact form, and navigation

How to run locally
1. git clone https://github.com/Coderio10/tobi-portfolio.git  
2. cd tobi-portfolio  
3. npm install  
4. npm run dev (or npm start)  
5. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the dev server URL shown)

### 2) Study-CSC
Repo: https://github.com/Coderio10/Study-CSC  
Short: Study resource repo for core computer science concepts — notes, examples, and small demos.

Tech
- Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript examples, possibly React demos

What I focused on
- Curating concise, example-driven notes for common CS topics
- Small interactive examples to illustrate algorithms and data structures
- Readme-style documentation so others can learn quickly

How to run locally
- If it's a static site:
  1. git clone https://github.com/Coderio10/Study-CSC.git  
  2. cd Study-CSC  
  3. Open the markdown files in your editor or run a local markdown server (live-server / docs script)
- If it contains a React app:
  1. npm install  
  2. npm run dev

### 3) Acceede_clone
Repo: https://github.com/Coderio10/Acceede_clone  
Short: Front-end clone of the Acceede landing/product site — practice in pixel-perfect layout and responsive behavior.

Tech
- HTML, CSS (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript or minimal React

What I focused on
- Pixel-accurate layout and responsive breakpoints
- Recreating interactive UI elements (menus, modals, carousels) from the original
- Cross-browser compatibility and small performance optimizations

How to run locally
1. git clone https://github.com/Coderio10/Acceede_clone.git  
2. cd Acceede_clone  
3. Open index.html in a browser OR run a simple HTTP server:
   - npx http-server .  
   - Open http://localhost:8080

## Skills & Tools
- Core: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React  
- Styling: CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, styled-components, responsive design, Flexbox, Grid  
- Tooling: Git, GitHub, Vite / CRA, npm / yarn, ESLint, Prettier  
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (end-to-end)  
- Performance & Accessibility: Lighthouse, Web Vitals, axe-core

---

## How I present projects (what to expect)
For each featured repo I aim to provide:
- Live demo (Vercel / Netlify) and screenshots/GIFs
- Clear README with purpose, setup, and usage
- Component breakdown (key components and why)
- Tests and CI status (GitHub Actions)
- Short note on performance & accessibility improvements made

---

## Roadmap & next steps
- Add Storybook for component-driven documentation across projects  
- Add automated CI with linting, tests, and a11y checks for each repo  
- Convert portfolio to TypeScript + add micro-interactions and performance budgets  
- Build a small end-to-end product (React front-end + simple server) to show full-stack collaboration and deployment
